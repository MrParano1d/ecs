# Entity Component System

An entity component system written in go.

It's very inspired by the [bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Current State

WIP.

For now, I'm only using it to learn OpenGL in my [Pong game](https://github.com/mrparano1d/pong), which is why the API can change constantly.

See unit tests for potential usage.
